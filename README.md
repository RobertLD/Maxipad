This will create a copy of this repository in your account, that you are free to modify.

### Clone the repository

Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository that you just created, click on the clone button and then click the *copy to clipboard* icon.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```
git clone "url you just copied"
```
where "url you just copied" (without the quote marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project). See the previous steps to obtain the url.

For example:
```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_NAME/Maxipad/
```
where `YOUR_NAME` is your GitHub username. Here you're copying the contents of the MaxiPad repository on your GitHub account to your computer.

### Create a branch 

**Important**

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```
cd MaxiPad
```
Now create a branch using the `git checkout` command:
```
git checkout -b <add-your-new-branch-name>
```

For example:
```
git checkout -b update-random-feature-maxipad
```
(The name of the branch should be descriptive of what you have changed)

### Make necessary changes and commit those changes

Add all the changes to the branch you just created using the `git add .` command:

Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:
```
git commit -m "Descriptive message about changes here"
```

```
git push origin <add-your-branch-name>

replacing `<add-your-branch-name>` with the name of the branch you created earlier.

### Submit your changes for review

If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a  `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button.


Now submit the pull request.


If you didn't break everything, I'll probably add your changes regardless of what it is. The point of MaxiPad is to be ridiculous. So if its a fun addition, I'll add it right away! I hope if you're like me, a intermediate programmer, you can get your first real contribution to open-source software right here. Thanks for going through the whole README.md, you're a real chap.
